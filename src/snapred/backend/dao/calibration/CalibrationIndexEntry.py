class CalibrationIndexEntry(IndexEntry):
    """

    The CalibrationIndexEntry class is a Pydantic model designed to encapsulate the details of
    calibration index entries, including essential information like runNumber, version, and
    comments, along with the author and a timestamp. It features a specialized method, parseAppliesTo,
    to interpret the appliesTo field, which indicates the applicability of the calibration entry,
    supporting comparisons with symbols such as '>', '<', '>=', and '<='. Additionally, a validator,
    appliesToFormatChecker, ensures the appliesTo field conforms to expected formats, either a simple
    'runNumber' or a comparison format, enhancing data integrity by enforcing consistent entry formats.

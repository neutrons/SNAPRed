DiffCalAssessmentView Class Documentation
=========================================

DiffCalAssessmentView provides a user-friendly interface within the SNAPRed application,
aimed at facilitating the review and selection process for calibration assessments. Through
its thoughtful integration of informative labels, a calibration record dropdown menu, and
interactive buttons, this view enhances user interaction and navigation. It is designed to
work in conjunction with the CalibrationAssessmentPresenter to enable efficient backend
communication for loading and displaying relevant calibration data based on user selections.


Integration and Functionality:
------------------------------

- CalibrationAssessmentPresenter: This view is tightly integrated with CalibrationAssessmentPresenter
  for handling the loading of selected calibration assessments and updating the UI with the calibration
  index or error messages as appropriate.

- Signal Handling: Utilizes custom signals for communication within the view, such as signalRunNumberUpdate
  for initiating calibration index loading and signalError for displaying error messages.

- Dynamic Content Update: Facilitates real-time updates to the calibration record dropdown menu based on
  the calibration index, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of displayed information.


Operational Flow:
-----------------

1. Upon initialization, the view sets up its layout and components, preparing for user interaction.
2. User actions, like selecting a calibration record and clicking the load button, trigger corresponding
   processes managed by the CalibrationAssessmentPresenter.
3. The presenter communicates with the backend to fetch calibration data, which is then reflected in the
   view through dynamic content updates or error notifications.

CalibrationAssessmentPresenter Class Documentation
==================================================

CalibrationAssessmentPresenter acts as a mediator between the user interface and
the backend calibration assessment and indexing processes. It utilizes a WorkerPool
for managing asynchronous tasks and an InterfaceController for API communication,
efficiently handling user requests to load calibration assessments and indexes for
specific run configurations.


Key Functionalities:
--------------------

- Load Selected Calibration Assessment: Facilitates the loading of a specific calibration
  assessment based on the selected run ID and version. Validates the presence of a selected
  calibration record and initiates a backend request to retrieve the corresponding assessment.

- Load Calibration Index: Manages the retrieval of the calibration index for a given run number.
  Initiates a backend request to fetch and display the calibration index, enhancing user interaction
  with available calibration data.

- Error Handling and UI Updates: Provides feedback to the user in case of errors or upon successful
  retrieval of calibration data. It ensures that the UI reflects the current state of data availability
  and selection status.


Operational Details:
--------------------

1. Initializes with a reference to the UI view component, enabling direct interaction and UI updates.
2. Utilizes the WorkerPool to execute backend requests in background threads, preventing UI blocking and
   enhancing application responsiveness.
3. Communicates with the backend through the InterfaceController, sending calibration assessment and index
   requests as needed.
4. Connects worker task outcomes to signal handlers for processing results, updating the UI, or presenting
   error messages as appropriate.

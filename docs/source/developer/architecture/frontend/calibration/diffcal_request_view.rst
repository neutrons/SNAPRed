DiffCalRequestView Class Documentation
======================================

DiffCalRequestView is a view in the SNAPRed application, specifically tailored for configuring
and initiating diffraction calibration requests. Enhanced with the Resettable decorator to
support dynamic UI updates, it incorporates an array of user input mechanisms such as text fields,
toggles, and dropdown menus. These elements allow users to specify calibration parameters including
run number, lite mode preference, convergence threshold, peak intensity threshold, bins across peak
width, and peak function selection from a list of symmetric peak types.


Operational Highlights:
-----------------------

- Integration with BackendRequestView: Inherits from BackendRequestView, leveraging its robust
  infrastructure for backend communication and request handling.

- Dynamic UI Adjustments: Enabled by the Resettable decorator, allowing for real-time UI updates
  and resets based on user interaction and workflow requirements.

- Comprehensive Verification Process: Implements a rigorous verification method to ensure the
  validity and completeness of user inputs before submission.

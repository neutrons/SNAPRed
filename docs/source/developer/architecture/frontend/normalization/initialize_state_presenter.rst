InitializeStatePresenter Class Documentation
============================================

InitializeStatePresenter is a class derived from QObject, designed to facilitate the interaction between the user interface (UI) and the backend for
initializing the state of instruments or processes. It plays a critical role in handling user inputs, validating them, and managing requests to the
backend to carry out state initialization tasks based on provided parameters. The class ensures that the UI reflects the outcomes of these backend
interactions, maintaining a seamless and responsive user experience.


Funtionality and Workflow:
--------------------------

- User Input Handling: InitializeStatePresenter captures and validates user inputs from the UI, such as run numbers and state names. It ensures that
  inputs meet specific criteria before proceeding with backend requests.

- State Initialization Requests: Upon validating user inputs, the presenter constructs and sends requests to the backend to initiate the state
  initialization process. It leverages the InterfaceController to manage these requests and handle responses.

- UI Updates: Based on the responses from the backend, the presenter updates the UI accordingly. This includes displaying error messages for invalid
  inputs or errors during initialization and enabling or disabling UI components based on the process state.

- Success Feedback: When state initialization is successfully completed, the presenter emits the stateInitialized signal and displays a success
  dialog, providing visual confirmation to the user.


Attributes:
-----------

- worker_pool (WorkerPool): Utilized to manage and execute background tasks, this attribute significantly enhances UI responsiveness by offloading
  intensive operations to a separate thread pool. It allows the main UI thread to remain responsive and fluid during backend operations.

- stateInitialized ``Signal``): A Qt signal emitted upon the successful completion of a state initialization process. This signal is connected to
  UI components that need to react or update based on the initialization outcome, facilitating real-time feedback and interactions within the
  application.

- view: Represents the view component with which this presenter is associated. It is typically a form or UI dialog that provides user input fields
  and feedback mechanisms. The view attribute is integral to the presenter's operation, enabling it to retrieve user inputs and update the UI based
  on backend responses.

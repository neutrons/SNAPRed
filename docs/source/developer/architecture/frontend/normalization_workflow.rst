NormalizationWorkflow Class Documentation
=========================================

NormalizationWorkflow orchestrates a comprehensive and interactive workflow for scientific data normalization tasks within applications. Leveraging
PyQt5 widgets and custom views, it guides users through every step of the normalization process. Starting from initialization with default settings,
the workflow progresses through calibration, parameter adjustments, and concludes with saving the normalization data. It ensures a responsive,
user-friendly experience while maintaining flexibility in the workflow and data integrity through thorough validation and error handling.


Core Functionalities:
---------------------

- Initialization: Begins with default settings, loading necessary configurations, sample paths, and grouping maps to prepare for the normalization
  process.

- Interactive Views: Utilizes NormalizationRequestView, NormalizationTweakPeakView, and NormalizationSaveView to facilitate each phase of the
  normalization process, from initial user inputs to the final data-saving step.

- Dynamic Adaptation: Adapts dynamically to different datasets and normalization requirements by updating dropdown lists with configurations and user
  selections, ensuring the workflow remains flexible and applicable to various scenarios.


Workflow Steps:
---------------

#. Normalization Calibration Request: Captures essential user inputs such as run numbers and sample paths, initiating the normalization calibration
   process with the backend.

#. Parameter Tweaking: Enables interactive adjustment of parameters (e.g., smoothing, dMin, dMax, peak intensity thresholds), with real-time
   visualization of changes through graphical plots, enhancing user engagement and understanding of parameter impacts.

#. Saving Normalization Data: Collects final details required for saving normalization data, including comments and authorship information, ensuring
   a comprehensive documentation of the normalization process.


Dynamic Configuration and Adaptation:
-------------------------------------

- Integrates UI elements seamlessly with backend operations, offering a dynamic and responsive user experience. This setup ensures that the workflow
  is adaptable and efficient, catering to specific normalization tasks and datasets.


Signal-Slot Mechanism for Asynchronous Updates:
-----------------------------------------------

- Utilizes PyQt's signal-slot mechanism to manage asynchronous UI updates, enhancing the application's responsiveness. This mechanism ensures that
  users receive timely feedback on their interactions and the progress of normalization tasks.


Validation and Error Handling:
------------------------------

- Implements robust validation checks and error handling across the workflow to verify user inputs and configurations. This approach enhances the
  overall robustness and reliability of the normalization process, safeguarding against invalid data inputs and configurations.


NormalizationWorkflow epitomizes an efficient method for managing the complex process of scientific data normalization, providing users with a
structured, intuitive path from data input to result visualization and saving. Through its carefully designed steps and interactive elements, it
significantly contributes to a smooth and effective user experience in applications requiring detailed normalization of scientific data.

CalibrationService Class Documentation
======================================

CalibrationService orchestrates a comprehensive suite of calibration processes to support
scientific data analysis. This service seamlessly integrates multiple components, including
RunConfig, CalibrationRecord, and FocusGroupMetric, and utilizes an array of recipes like
DiffractionCalibrationRecipe and GenerateCalibrationMetricsWorkspaceRecipe. These components
and recipes work in concert to facilitate a holistic calibration workflowâ€”spanning from state
initialization, ingredient preparation, and grocery fetching, to executing recipes for diffraction
calibration, focusing spectra, saving calibration data, and loading quality assessments.


Key Processes:
--------------

- State Initialization: Sets up the initial state for calibration, preparing the system for
  subsequent calibration tasks.

- Ingredient Preparation: Utilizes prepDiffractionCalibrationIngredients to prepare necessary
  inputs for diffraction calibration, ensuring all required data is ready for processing.

- Grocery Fetching: Employs fetchDiffractionCalibrationGroceries to organize workspace names
  and other necessary data, setting the stage for calibration execution.

- Execution of Recipes: Manages the execution of various recipes, including diffraction
  calibration through DiffractionCalibrationRecipe, focusing spectra with FocusSpectraRecipe,
  and generating calibration metrics workspaces via GenerateCalibrationMetricsWorkspaceRecipe.


Operational Highlights:
-----------------------

- Diffraction Calibration: Facilitates the calibration of scientific data against known
  crystallographic standards, adjusting and refining calibration parameters for optimal accuracy.

- Focus Spectra: Supports focusing spectra for detailed analysis, enhancing the clarity and
  precision of calibration efforts.

- Saving Calibration Data: Manages the saving of calibration results, including calibration
  records and metrics, ensuring data integrity and traceability.

- Loading Quality Assessments: Enables the loading of calibration quality assessments, facilitating
  a comprehensive evaluation of calibration effectiveness and accuracy.

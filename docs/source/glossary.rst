    Algorithm
        A set of instructions that can be executed to produce a result.
        In the context of SNAP, this mostly refers to Mantid Algorithms or collections of Mantid Algorithms triggered by a Recipe.
        Base Mantid Algorithm Index: https://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/categories/AlgorithmIndex.html
        There are also a collection of custom algorithms that are used to perform SNAP specific tasks in this repo.

    API Layer
        The architectural layer that provides the single point of interaction between the backend and frontend.
        Agnostic of frontend implementation, it recieves requests from the frontend and forwards them to the corresponding Service.
        In addition it is also responsible for catching errors, and returning a human readable error message to the frontend.

    Background Run Number
        The identifier for a background run, which is a measurement taken under the same conditions as a
        primary experimental run but without the sample present. This data is used to subtract background noise
        and artifacts from the experimental data, enabling more accurate analysis. In the context of SNAP, the
        Background Run ID refers to the unique ID associated with such a run, used in processes like
        :term:`Normalization` to correct the primary data set.

    Calibrant Samples
        A json configuration representing various phyiscal properties of known samples that are used to calibrate the instrument.
        Most notably, the cif file that contains the known crystallographic properties of the sample.

    Calibration
        The process by which the instrument state configuration is calibrated to account for the effects of the instrument on the diffraction data.
        This is done by comparing the diffraction data to a known standard or previous Calibration, and adjusting the instrument to match.
        This is done by a series of algorithms that are triggered by a Recipe.

        TODO

    Calibration Index
        The data/file that contains a ledger of which Calibration applies to which Run in a given Instrument State.

    Calibration Mask
        The outcome of various systematic effects can lead to failures in pixel event detection. This may cause the calibration process to fail for individual or
        groups of pixels. These are handled by creating a mask indicating which faulty pixels will not be used in any reduction employing the related
        calibration.

    Calibration Record
        This is a file written to the :term: `state <State>` calibration folder that contains a record  of information related to the calibration.
        This includes all of the parameters that govern the calibration, the location of all the files generated during the calibration (e.g. calibration
        mask) and also some statistical information capturing the "quality" of the calibration.

        A domain expert, usually responsible for all aspects of data collection and reduction using a given instrument.

    Config
        A configuration mapping used to control many configurable aspects of the SNAPRed application.
        This is implemented as a mapping between multiple-key sequences, represented as "<key-1>.<key-2>. ... <key-n>", and string and number values, such as paths or default-parameter values.
        At the start of the application, this configuration is initialized from the YAML-format file ``application.yml`` (, which may be overridden using the ``dev.yml`` file).

    Data Component
        The architectural Component that provides an abstraction for data aquisition and storage.
        It provides a means for the rest of the backend to interact with data without having to worry about the underlying implementation.
        It handles serialization and deserialization of data to terms the backend is familiar with.
        Example: A user may request a Calibration for a specific run, regardless of whether the data is stored on a remote server or locally,
        it will be retrieved, deserialized, and returned.

    Data State Management
        The process by which the backend manages the state of the data it is working with.
        This includes things like Caching, Serialization, Deserialization, Calculation, and Transformation.

    Normalization
        The process of adjusting diffraction data to correct for variations in instrumental performance and experimental conditions.
        Normalization ensures that data from different runs or different :term:`instrument states <Instrument State>` can be directly
        compared or combined without bias due to instrument efficiency, sample positioning, or other systemic factors. This is typically
        achieved by dividing the raw data by a normalization standard, such as a vanadium run, which represents the instrument response.
        The process involves a series of algorithms, often encapsulated within a Recipe, to apply these corrections and produce normalized
        data suitable for further analysis or interpretation.

        Smoothing is a technique used to reduce noise and enhance signal clarity, making it easier to identify and
        analyze peaks in the data. The smoothing parameter determines the extent of this smoothing effect, with
        higher values leading to a smoother signal. It is often adjusted as part of the :term:`Normalization` or

        A reference material commonly used in neutron diffraction experiments for calibration and normalization
        purposes due to its well-understood scattering properties. Vanadium calibration is essential for
        instrument performance verification and for correcting systematic errors in diffraction data. It plays a

    Algorithm
        A set of instructions that can be executed to produce a result.
        In the context of SNAP, this mostly refers to Mantid Algorithms or collections of Mantid Algorithms triggered by a Recipe.
        Base Mantid Algorithm Index: https://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/algorithms/categories/AlgorithmIndex.html
        There are also a collection of custom algorithms that are used to perform SNAP specific tasks in this repo.

    API Layer
        The architectural layer that provides the single point of interaction between the backend and frontend.
        Agnostic of frontend implementation, it recieves requests from the frontend and forwards them to the corresponding Service.
        In addition it is also responsible for catching errors, and returning a human readable error message to the frontend.

    Calibration
        The process by which the instrument state configuration is calibrated to account for the effects of the instrument on the diffraction data.
        This is done by comparing the diffraction data to a known standard or previous Calibration, and adjusting the instrument to match.
        This is done by a series of algorithms that are triggered by a Recipe.

    Calibration Index
        The data/file that contains a ledger of which Calibration applies to which Run in a given Instrument State.

    Data Object Layer
        The architectural layer that represents concepts and contracts as easily validated and serializable objects.
        It consists entirely of Pydantic models with minimal to no buisness logic.
        These objects represent things like Requests, Focus Groups, Instrument State, etc.

    Data Layer
        The architectural layer that provides an abstraction for data aquisition and storage.
        It provides a means for the rest of the backend to interact with data without having to worry about the underlying implementation.
        It handles serialization and deserialization of data to terms the backend is familiar with.
        Example: A user may request a Calibration for a specific run, regardless of whether the data is stored on a remote server or locally,
        it will be retrieved, deserialized, and returned.

    Diffraction Focussing

    Focus Groups
        A predetermined set of parameters used to split diffraction data into useful formations, i.e. like slices vs squares of pizza
        This may include predetermined data such as dimmensions and tolerances, or derrived values such as Pixel Grouping Parameters

    Histogram
        TODO

    Instrument
        The phyiscal apparatus used to collect diffraction data. In the case of SNAP, it consists of a sample to shoot neutrons at,
        a source that provides said neutrons, and a few detectors whos positions may vary depending on the experiment.
        The configuration of these components define what is referred to as an Instrument State.

    Instrument State
        The configuration of an instrument at a given point in time. This includes the positions of the detectors, the sample, and the source.
        It is also dependant on a number of other configurations relating to the instrument.

    Mantid Snapper
        A thin wrapper around the Mantid Algorithm API that allows for meta processes to be performed around a queue of algorithms.
        Examples may include: Progress reporting, Quality of Life improvements, multi-threading, etc.

    Pixel Grouping
        TODO

    Pixel Grouping Parameters
        TODO

    Reduction
        The process by which raw diffraction data is filtered, distilled into more compact and meaningful data that a scientist may draw conclusions from.

    Recipe
        A collection of algorithms or calculations that are triggered by a request to perform a specific task.
        Examples include: Reduction, Calculate Pixel Grouping Parameters, Purge Overlapping Peaks etc.

    Resouce
        Small, static configuration data stored within the codebase that may easily be looked up via relative path or key.

    Run
        A single collection of diffraction data that was collected at a specific point in time.
        It is identified by a unique ID, and is associated with a specific Instrument State and Calibration.

    Service Layer
        The architectural layer that provides the individual units of backend fuctionality that a user may interact with.
        Examples include: Data Reduction, Calibration Quality Assessment, Instrument State Initialization, etc.
        It provides this functionality by orchestrating Data and Recipes layers to produce the expected results.
